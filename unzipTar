tar comes from when you stored archive on magnetic tape 
tar.gz is nothing but a archive that is compressed

X = tells tar to exstract the files 
v = stands for verbose this will list all the files one by one 
z = tells tar to ucompress the file (gzip)
f = tell tar what file to work with

-A tarbar is a bundle of archives zipped together

-To unzip tar files :: say the file is abc.tar.gz then do the following
in to containing folder

$ tar -xvzf abc.tar.gz
or
$ tar -xzf abc.tar.gz

-to uncompress to a diffrent directory then containing 

$ tar -xvzf abc.tar.gz-C/path/to/somedirectory

-to exstract file.doc from a tarball 

$ tar -xvzf abc.tar.gz test.doc

-to view detailed table of contents of all files in archive 

$tar -tvf abc.tar.gz

-to exstract gzip without tar 

$ gunzip abc.gz

-Exstracting .tar.bz2 files

this is the same as gzip decompresstion the major diffrence z option is 
replaced with j

j = z
j = decompressed bz2 files 

$ tar xvjf abc.tar.bz2
